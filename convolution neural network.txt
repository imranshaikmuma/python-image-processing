Machine learning:
machine figuring out an equation to solve a specific problem based on some example data
its an idea that generic algorithm can tell you something about the data without having to write any custom code specific to the problem
it builds its own logic based on the data
it is of two types:
supervised and unsupervised

Batch gradient descent:
it helps us in predicting closer to the real values
it does it by using the slope of the function between input and target variables(derivate of a function) to move close to the real and acutal values


linear regression wont work all the time as not all target variables have a linear relationship with input variables
To handle non-linear data , we use Neural networks,Support vector machines with kernels


Neural networks:
In linear regression, we simply multiply each input variable to get the output variable. However, it doesnt take into consideration of the importance of each variable
in neural networks, each node take inputs and apply weights to them, and calculate output value.
This simple function of multiplying input variables to separate weights and generating output is called neurons.

We add so many neurons to handle even complex problems

This neural network is a stateless algorithm as it doesnt have a memory, meaning it doesnt save the state of the model to use to for next stage of calculation

So we use Recurrent neural network(RNN) which is stateful algorithm in cases like predicting the second letter of a work given first letter

Recognizing objects with neural network:
Conventional neural network works with object detection only when the object is in the middle of an image
To even detect image , when it is at a corner of an image, we will use either Sliding window or Convolution neural network.

In CNN, it creates overlapping tiles of image, feed each tile into neural network(gives same weight to each tile so as to treat each tile equally), downsample the array(
it means it only select tiles of importance--by selecting max value in 2/2 grid of array), and again finally passes into a fully connected neural network and finally
classify the image
